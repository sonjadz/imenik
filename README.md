App I created allows people to enter the directory ie. in the database. On the home page (index.php) is located a few basic fields that provide general information about the user and the submit button ("Upisi se") that allows insertion of these data into the database.Before entering the data we need to make a connection to the database (konekcija.php).Enter the data can be browsed from the database by clicking on the "izlistavanje imenika".Part application that allows this action is upis.php. After entering and storing data in the database, it is possible their listing without reloading the page. On the overview page, we can delete a person from the directory.Sorting is possible according to the user name.

Dealing with errors was done in the form to view and delete a person from the phone book, so you can check the ID of the person, whether the number and zero if it is passed validation, whether it exists in the database.

This project was developed for the purpose of the Faculty.
